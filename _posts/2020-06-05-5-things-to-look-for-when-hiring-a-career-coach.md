title: 5 things to look for when hiring a career coach

I recently decided to find and utilize a career coach for my personal development. 
I had a great mentor at my last job but the chance of having someone like this again as my boss was slim-to-none. some things I was looking for were:

1. honesty - I needed someone to be perfectly blunt for better or worse
1. drive -  everyone needs a push sometimes and I want my coach to push me through the veil of 'being-too-afraid-to-do-it'
1. connection - to me coaching is a little like therapy and I need to click with the coach to feel good doing it
1. long-term commitment - one of the things that were of utmost importance was that both parties could agree to work together for years
1. mindset - perhaps the most crucial character trade - I want to lead organizations by example, amplify minority-voices and promote learning over knowing at the job and I expect my coach to uphold these values as well
